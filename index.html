            <p><strong><a href="https://guides.loc.gov/zines/introduction" target="_blank">An academic definition</a>:</strong> "A zine, short for fanzine or magazine, is a DIY & subculture self-publication, usually made on paper and reproduced with a photocopier or printer. Zine creators are often motivated by a desire to share knowledge or experience with people in marginalized or otherwise less-empowered communities"</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://www.zinebook.com/whatcha1.html">A spunky definition:</a></strong> "Zines (pronounced "zeens," from fanzines) are cut-and-paste, "sorry this is late," self-published magazines reproduced at Kinko's or on the sly at work and distributed through mail order and word of mouth. They touch on sex, music, politics, television, movies, work, food, whatever. They're Tinkertoys for malcontents. They're obsessed with obsession. They're extraordinary and ordinary. They're about strangeness but since it's usually happening somewhere else you're kind of relieved. You can get to know people pretty well through their zines, which are always more personal and idiosyncratic than glossy magazines because glossies and the celebrities they worship are so busy being well known."</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://guides.library.cornell.edu/zines101/home" target="_blank">A little more about what zines are:</a></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zines are made for the love of creating and not for profit.</li>
                <li>Independently published.</li>
                <li>Can be physical (as simple as copy paper stapled together) or digital (like a website).</li>
                <li>Can be made solo or with a group of people.</li>
                <li>The contents can be about anything and everything you can imagine: personal stories ("perzines"), music-related writing, lists of things, political ideologies, photography, mental health and self-care tips, fiction, artwork, comics, and so on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Zine Distros:</strong> Zines are acquired via zine distributors. Often, the distributor is the author themselves. However, zines are also distributed via independent booksellers, artist collectives, and community organizations. In the age of the internet, creators can submit zines to various organizations via email or form submission. These methods allow for zines to be shared to a greater audience.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://guides.library.cornell.edu/zines101/history" target="_blank">Why are zines important?</a></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zines provide spaces for marginalized voices and stories that are excluded from traditional publishing.</li>
                <li>Zines challenge us to think about authority in differing contexts.</li>
                <li>Zines reframe topics we talk about in class and life.</li>
                <li>Zines allow us to channel our thoughts creatively into art.</li>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>What is the origin of zines?</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Zines have been around since the early 20th century. The earliest zine in the U.S.A. dates back to 1930. It was a science fiction publication called <em>The Coment</em>, created by the Science Correspondence Club. The zine cultivated a community of science fiction fans as there was a letter section that provided space for discussion.</p>
            <p>Science fiction fanzines continued to grow into the 1940s. A fanzine is a magazine produced by fans of a specific cultural phenomenon, the term being coined by Louis "Russ" Chauvenet, one of the founders of science fiction fandom. Science fiction authors such as Ray Bradbury, Jack Williamson, and Robert Heinlein created zines as well. In addition to the continued growth of science fiction zines, Beat Poetry chapbooks emerged in the 1940s, by poets such as Allen Ginsburg. The 1940s is also when the first ever queer fanzine was published by Edythe Eyde (aka Lisa Ben).</p>
            <p>In the 1970s, punk fanzines and zines emerged. The 1990s saw the creation of the "Riot Grrrl" movement, which used zines as a medium to discuss feminism and issues surrounding gender identity.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>How zines cultivate an information undercommons?</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> As I read about the early origins of zines, and its roots being science fiction, it made me think about our lecture on world building. For example, one of Ray Bradbury's most well known works is <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, a story taking place in a dystopian future where books are outlawed and firemen start fires to burn any that are found. The protagonist of the story is a fireman who becomes disillusioned by the society he is living in, and his role within it, and attempts to preserve the books. The book was written during the McCarthy era and Second Red scare. It was inspired by the ideological repression exhibited in the Soviet Union, as well as book burnings in Nazi Germany. The early days of zines being embedded within the realm of science fiction showcases an interesting intersection between underground publishing, world building, and the development of an information undercommons.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> As mentioned above, the 1940s and 1950s saw an emergence of beat poetry chapbooks by poets such as Allen Ginsburg. A chapbook is a pocket-sized booklet. The origin of chapbooks dates back to the 17th century. Like zines, chapbooks were a critical medium for distributing popular culture to common folks. The Beat Generation is a literary subculture movement that explored and influenced American culture and politics post-World War II. The poets of this generation rebelled against mainstream American life and writing. The movement challenged the conventional structure of American society by questioning materialism, criticizing capitalism, and challenging taboos, particularly around sexuality. Beat poetry is a form of poetry that is surrealistic and mostly free verse. Underground music styles, such as jazz, were a source of inspiration being many of the beat poetry written during the time. The Beat Generation is an example of an undercommons - it was a social and cultural phenomenon that was led by a collective of writers and thinkers whom directly opposed mainstream culture and structure. The work that was created was distributed via underground publishing in the form of chapbooks, and was inspired by Jazz (an underground music style) and Native American spirituality (cultural influences from a marginalized group).(<em><a href="https://www.online-literature.com/periods/beat.php" target="_blank">Source 1</a>, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/147552/an-introduction-to-the-beat-poets" target="_blank">Source 2</a></em>)</p>
            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> In 1950s Soviet Union, <em>Samizdat</em> was created. This was a literary publication that was written, copied, and distributed in secret. It was critical of Soviet ideology and government. These zines were manually reproduced (by hand!) because printing devices, such as the typewriter, required official registration and permission to access. <em>Samizdat</em> is a form of information undercommons because it is an underground literary publication that was created to challenging the Soviet Union, which had a strictly enforced censorship policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 4:</strong> The punk fanzines created during the 1970s to 1990s relied on zines to distribute information about music groups, venues, and events. Zines were used as a means of rejecting corporate labels and mainstream publications.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 5:</strong> <em>Fire!!</em> magazine was a literary magazine that was published during the Harlem Renaissance, an intellectual and cultural revival of African-American arts and culture centered in Harlem, NYC. <em>Fire!!</em>, among other "little magazines", were used by African-American artists and writers to undermine the established literary system. <em>Fire!!</em> discussed controversial issues such as sexuality and prostitution. It was one of the first magazines to be completely written and published by African Americans. It provided a platform for young Black authors (<em><a href="https://firemagazinenow.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Source 1</a>, <a href="https://lva-virginia.libguides.com/c.php?g=1332410&p=9812968" target="_blank">Source 2</a></em>).</p>
            <p>Today, zines continue to serve as a means to distribute information, bring awareness, and initiate discussion about societal issues, controversial and taboo topics, and social/political/economic movements, among many other things. While social media has provided a way to disseminate information at a much quicker and larger scale, it doesn't provide true anonymity. Below are organizations that are active in the New York City zine scene.</p>
